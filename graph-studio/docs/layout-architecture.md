# Layout architecture

`src/layout` turns graph documents and view settings into renderable stage data. Modules are grouped by chart family; controllers own React state and asynchronous job lifecycles.

## Construction pipelines

Node-link construction runs through `input.ts` → `nodes.ts` → `position.ts` → `stage.ts`. `algorithm.ts` dispatches to the existing Dagre, level and Sugiyama implementations in `algorithms/`. The public `buildStageData` entry also retains Sankey validation/fallback and spatial dispatch.

Timeline construction runs through `prepare.ts` → `arrange.ts` → `stage.ts`. `prepare.ts` resolves selection, time bounds, settings, fonts and the axis. `nodes.ts` creates event nodes using that prepared context. `arrange.ts` allocates channels, applies explicit positions and packs labels. `stage.ts` assembles edges, bounds and orientation; `edge-routing.ts` owns edge anchors and route construction. Pipeline objects are local, mutable construction state: arrangement updates event positions and stage assembly adds edge ports to nodes. They are not persisted documents.

Compound layout constraints and scope rules live in `constraints.ts`; `placement.ts` positions rectangles; `layout-solver.ts` generates, validates and ranks candidates. `routing/` separates geometry, ports, cost calculation, labels and path search from route orchestration in `router.ts`. Existing layout parameters and candidate ordering are retained.

## Types and text measurement

`shared/algorithm-types.ts` describes algorithm coordinates and routes. `shared/types.ts` describes renderable stages, and re-exports algorithm and timeline types for shared consumers. Timeline-specific stage fields live in `timeline/stage-types.ts`; its dependency on `StageData` is type-only.

Browser Canvas access lives in [adapters/textMeasurement.ts](../src/adapters/textMeasurement.ts). `shared/text-estimate.ts` contains the deterministic width estimate for environments without Canvas. `shared/text-measurement.ts` connects them, while `shared/text.ts` retains the text fitting API. Compound worker inputs contain measured rectangles and edge-label sizes; timeline candidates reuse measured baseline label widths and display titles. Other worker text measurements retain the deterministic fallback.

## Worker boundary

Requests have `{ jobId, payload }`. Responses are either `{ jobId, ok: true, result }` or `{ jobId, ok: false, error }`. The worker handler echoes the request ID and converts synchronous failures into error responses.

Controllers retain cancellation, termination, timeout handling and graph/view freshness checks. Both controllers ignore responses for a different job ID. The timeline worker also restores graph indexes lost during structured cloning before evaluating a candidate.
